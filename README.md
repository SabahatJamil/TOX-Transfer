# TOX-Transfer
#Introduction
This repository contains code for performing transfer learning on the ClinTox dataset using the Simple Transformers module in Python. The ClinTox dataset consists of data for compounds that have been rejected for toxicity in clinical trials. The goal is to leverage transfer learning techniques to train a model that can accurately predict toxicity based on pre-trained language models.
Introduction
This repository contains code for predicting the toxicity of compounds from Semen Coicis and Panax Ginseng, filtering FDA-approved compounds against Ulcerative Colitis, and performing similarity analysis using Morgan fingerprints. The goal is to identify potentially non-toxic compounds from natural sources and assess their similarity to FDA-approved drugs.

Toxicity Prediction on Semen Coicis and Panax Ginseng Compounds:
Utilize the transfer learning model trained on the ClinTox dataset to predict the toxicity of compounds from Semen Coicis and Panax Ginseng.
Filtering FDA-Approved Compounds for Ulcerative Colitis:
Identify FDA-approved compounds specifically used against Ulcerative Colitis.
Calculation of Morgan Fingerprints:
Generate Morgan fingerprints for each compound to represent their molecular structure.
Similarity Analysis:
Evaluate the similarity between compounds from Semen Coicis and Panax Ginseng and the selected FDA-approved compounds against Ulcerative Colitis.
Final Compound Filtering:
Based on toxicity predictions and similarity analysis, filter compounds to identify potential non-toxic compounds with structural similarity to FDA-approved drugs for Ulcerative Colitis.
